# Custom Enchants plugin

Better Enchants is another plugin in the 'Better Plugins' plugin series. This plugin aims to create new, and exiciting enchantments for players, and create different enchantment mechanics for players to enjoy. This plugin also includes a dynamic enchantment targetting mechanic, where enchantments can be aimed at a specific item, or a specific group of items.

An example demonstration from one of the enchantments: Right click anywhere on a valid block. If you find yourself in any danger, like in the video, you can right click again to teleport to the previous block you clicked on, and escape.
